Tutorial = 'https://youtu.be/7eh4d6sabA0'

Steps
1. import the data
2. clean the data
3. split the data into training/test sets (80% and 20%)
4. create a model (using the algorithms from sci-kit)
5. Train the model
6. Make predictions
7. Evaluate and improve (increase the accuracy)

Libraries: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn (provides all kinds of algorithms like decision tree...etc.)
